# The Ages of sticks

## Description:
The Ages of sticks was developed in 2020, for a school project at HTX Aalborg.

This project is dead. I wont be updating or maintaining it.
The code in the project does not follow my current style of coding, or up to any standards.
the code is in other words, spaghetti code and properly filled with bugs. 

## Setup:
Either clone the reposity, or import the unity package file.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work.
